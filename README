RECLET -- a recursive LET for Common Lisp

This is close to macro LETREC but different. RECLET recursively defines the variables, not functions. It uses a laziness and SYMBOL-MACROLET to create recursive bindings. To define whether the recursive definitions are thread-safe, set special variable LAZY:*MEMO-THREAD-SAFE* to true.

Example 1: Fibonacci Sequence (using Generic Sequences)

(defparameter *fibs*
  (reclet 
      ((fibs (seq->stream
              (seq-cons
               1 (seq-cons
                  1 (seq-map 
                     #'+
                     (delay-seq fibs)
                     (delay-seq (seq-cdr fibs))))))))
    fibs))

Example 2: Non-strict Order

(reclet
    ((a c)
     (b 2)
     (c (+ b 1)))
   (list :a a :b b :c c))
